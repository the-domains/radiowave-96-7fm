description: "Instant messaging service WhatsApp’s move to encrypt its messages shows it’s serious about privacy, but it may run into problems with governments, say experts.\_  Facebook-owned WhatsApp this week announced that all messages, calls, images and video on its app would be encrypted so that not even WhatsApp employees could see the content. “In practice this means that WhatsApp is now one of the most secure ways to communicate electronically,” said Carey van Vlaanderen, chief executive of ESET Southern Africa. However, some governments may not easily accept encryption of the popular messaging application. India and Saudi Arabia in 2010 and 2012 moved to block BlackBerry’s BBM for its encryption on the grounds of national security. Privacy has also not proved to be very popular with online users."

Instant messaging service WhatsApp's move to encrypt its messages shows it's serious about privacy, but it may run into problems with governments, say experts.  Facebook-owned WhatsApp this week announced that all messages, calls, images and video on its app would be encrypted so that not even WhatsApp employees could see the content. "In practice this means that WhatsApp is now one of the most secure ways to communicate electronically," said Carey van Vlaanderen, chief executive of ESET Southern Africa. However, some governments may not easily accept encryption of the popular messaging application. India and Saudi Arabia in 2010 and 2012 moved to block BlackBerry's BBM for its encryption on the grounds of national security. Privacy has also not proved to be very popular with online users.
