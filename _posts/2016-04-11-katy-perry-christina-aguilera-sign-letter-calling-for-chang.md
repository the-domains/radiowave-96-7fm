Hundreds of artists, songwriters, managers, and other players in the music industry are calling on the U.S. Copyright Office to make what they consider to be long overdue changes to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a law they say is not only out-of-date, but detrimental to artists and the future of the industry.  Katy Perry, Fifth Harmony, Christina Aguilera and Bon Jovi are just some of 57 artists who signed a letter calling for a "sensible reform" of the act, which was signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1998\.  "The existing laws --- and their interpretation by judges --- threaten the continued viability of songwriters and recording artists to survive from the creation of music," the letter reads. "It has allowed major tech companies to grow and generate huge profits by creating ease of use for consumers to carry almost every recorded song in history in their pocket via a smartphone, while songwriters' and artists' earnings continue to diminish." The letter comes just over a week after a report by the Recording Industry Association of America that pointed out an "alarming disparity" between the rise in music consumption and revenue going to artists.  Specifically, they take issue with section 512, or the notice-and-takedown provision. While that may have been effective back when the law was passed in the dial-up era, it's ineffective at best now, since as soon as one illegal video is taken down, another one --- or another hundred --- is uploaded in its place. In their letter, artists called it "the all-purpose shield that tech companies hide behind while they threaten the livelihood of music creators."    "This outdated law forces us to stand by helplessly as billions of dollars in advertising is sold around illegal copies of our work," the letter reads.  A letter signed by 47 music managers warned that the copyright law's failure to protect creators discourages many young artists from pursuing a music career. They said the core problem of the law is "utter failure of the notice-and-takedown system to keep up with technological innovation and change."   "No one can police that vastness -- and anyone who tries to do so finds the universe online is growing faster than our ability to inspect it for illegal copies of our clients' work. Today, the instant an infringing link is taken down, it is replaced by many more. It's 'whack-a-mole' on steroids in which every time the mole is knocked down, two more pop up, then four, then eight." On Dec. 31, the Copyright Office announced a public study of section 512, inviting anyone to send feedback. "While Congress understood that it would be essential to address online infringement as the internet continued to grow, it may have been difficult to anticipate the online world as we now know it, where each day users upload hundreds of millions of photos, videos and other items, and service providers receive over a million notices of alleged infringement." Comments must be received by 11:59 p.m. Friday.  On Thursday, the Internet Association --- whose members include Facebook, Google, Amazon, Pandora, Twitter and more --- responded in a statement titled "DMCA Infringement Takedowns Work."    "These smart laws allow people to post content that they have created on platforms - such as videos, reviews, pictures, and text. In essence, this is what makes the Internet great," the statement read. "The safe harbors enable platforms to operate at the scale necessary to create huge benefits for consumers and creators. They have fueled the creation of a booming domestic Internet economy that was worth nearly $1 trillion or 6 percent of GDP in 2014."
