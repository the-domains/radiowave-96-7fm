Justin Bieber sure knows how to get attention --- good or bad. The pop star took a break from dominating Vevo views and wooing his ex, Selena Gomez, to attend Sunday night's iHeartRadio Music Awards with a brand new hairstyle: dreadlocks. He also shared a pic of his bleach blonde tresses on Instagram with a simple caption: "Why." Why, indeed. Passionate followers immediately shared their negative reactions, comparing the 'do to creepy Grinch fingers and naked mole rats. Other outraged followers viewed the new style as cultural appropriation, a criticism the singer also received when he showed off cornrows while on vacation in January.
