Higher Education prioritised in ministry's budget Details Category: Broadcast News Published on Friday, 08 April 2016 16:05 The Ministry of Higher Education, Training and Innovation has identified five programmes to which its share of the 2016/17 National Budget will be allocated.  The Minister said two thirds has been earmarked for operational activities, while the balance is for capital development. The minister said the post-secondary school gap deserves immediate close scrutiny and solutions. "There is an urgent need to increase tertiary education opportunities in Namibia. In this regard, the ministry is looking at different models, with a view to developing a proposal that will be shared with the public, before refinement and submission to Cabinet for approval," the minister said.
