description: "At a meeting with traditional leaders at the House of Traditional Leaders in Pretoria, President Jacob Zuma took a thinly veiled jab at the courts and their system of resolving disputes.\_  Zuma said \_that he would be “very happy that we solve the African problem in the African way, because if we solve them only legally, they become too complicated”. “The law looks at one side only; they do not look at any other thing. They deal with cold facts and I was complaining about that (but) they are dealing with warm bodies, that is the contradiction. I must not talk too much because I might get blamed for something I do not know. I only speak the truth,” he said. This is not the first time Zuma has made reference to the courts and how the African ways of solving things was better."

At a meeting with traditional leaders at the House of Traditional Leaders in Pretoria, President Jacob Zuma took a thinly veiled jab at the courts and their system of resolving disputes.  Zuma said  that he would be "very happy that we solve the African problem in the African way, because if we solve them only legally, they become too complicated". "The law looks at one side only; they do not look at any other thing. They deal with cold facts and I was complaining about that (but) they are dealing with warm bodies, that is the contradiction. I must not talk too much because I might get blamed for something I do not know. I only speak the truth," he said. This is not the first time Zuma has made reference to the courts and how the African ways of solving things was better.
